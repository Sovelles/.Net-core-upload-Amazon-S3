# .NET CORE App for upload to your AmazonS3 directly from client side 


IMPORTANT : This project goes with his Front-end at https://github.com/ranovladimir/Angular2-upload-Amazon-S3-from-client-side


This is the back-end part of a sample Angular2/ASP .NET CORE project that upload to Amazon S3 directly from client side.
Here it's a simple project for upload files from your client-side directly to your Amazon S3.

No more upload to the back-end first, thanks to the signature we build which allow a permission to the file.  



Usage : To get started, please read the README.txt file 



Hope that help !
